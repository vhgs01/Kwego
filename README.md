# Kwego
# Number Translation Problem

You have arrived in a long forgotten island, called kwego. After 3 days on this island, you realized that their numeric system is the same as the [roman system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) but with different names and came up with the following kwegonian to roman translation table:


kil = I <br />
jin = V <br />
pol = X <br />
kilow = L <br />
jij = C <br />
jinjin = D <br />
polsx = M <br />


To make your life easier, you will build a program to translate their kwegonian numbers into DECIMAL numbers.

Input: polsx polsx pol jin kil <br />
Output: 2016

You can use external libraries to build (e.g. rake) and test (e.g. rspec), but not to do the translation itself.
